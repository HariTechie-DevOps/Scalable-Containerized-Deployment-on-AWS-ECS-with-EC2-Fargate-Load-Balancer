# Scalable-Containerized-Deployment-on-AWS-ECS-with-EC2-Fargate-Load-Balancer
Designed and deployed a secure, highly available, and scalable on AWS using Amazon ECS with EC2, Docker, Amazon ECR, Fargate, and an Application Load Balancer. The deployment includes a containerized application hosted on ECS, ensuring automated scaling, high availability, and cost efficiency.

# ðŸ“Œ AWS ECS Deployment with EC2, Docker, ECR, Fargate & Load Balancer

# ðŸš€ Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a containerized application on AWS ECS using EC2 launch type while integrating services like:
âœ… Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) â€“ To store Docker images.
âœ… Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) â€“ To manage and deploy containers.
âœ… EC2 Instances â€“ To run ECS tasks with an autoscaling group.
âœ… AWS Fargate â€“ For serverless container deployment.
âœ… Application Load Balancer (ALB) â€“ For traffic distribution.
âœ… Amazon CloudWatch â€“ For monitoring and logging.

The architecture ensures scalability, high availability, and cost efficiency by leveraging AWS-native services.
